###Sites I used for inspiration
- [Block 16](http://block16omaha.com/) genius overall, but the menu especially.
- [El Burro](http://elburro.no/) cool idea for minimalist menu, great hierarchy and layout, colors perfect have to steal these guys' idea for "we're closed now"
- [Chick's Fry House](http://chicksfryhouse.com/) love that they're not doing very much, but the typography, hierarchy of that typography, layout and whitespace are doing tons for this site.
