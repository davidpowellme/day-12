####Principles to remember
1. **Emergence** - when our brains identify objects by site, they first match them to outlines we already know
2. **Reification** - our brains 'filling in gaps' so to speak
3. **Invariance** - our brains recognize objects' similarities despite differences in perspective, scale, rotation or even deformations
4. **Multistability** - If contrasting interpretations of an object exist, the mind will alternate between the two, but is incapable of seeing both at the same time.

####Principles for Design
1. **Similarity** - make objects that are alike _look_ alike
2. **Grouping** - place object that are related and have the same function within the same boundaries and in close proximity
3. **Closure** - users can complete objects in their heads, so you can be artistic and minimalistic (reification).
4. **Continuation** - users' eyes gain momentum when scouring pages. If you keep things linear, you can create motion for your users to understand what you're about and where you want them to go.
5. **Figure-Ground Relationship** - easy way to establish hierarchy/importance

this site gives me a headache. similar to treehouse except for a few additions:

####Principles
1. Basic principle of Gestalt: "the whole is other than the sum of the parts" - Kurt Koffka
2. **Law of Pragnanz** - “People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible.”
3. **Symmetry and Order** - “People tend to perceive objects as symmetrical shapes that form around their center.” We create order and symmetry
4. **Uniform Connectedness** - “Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.”
5. **Common Fate (Sychrony)** - “Elements that move in the same direction are perceived as more related than elements that are stationary or that move in different directions.”
6. **Focal Points** - “Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer’s attention.” use contrast to create focal points
7. **Past Experiences** - “Elements tend to be perceived according to an observer’s past experience.” think stoplights

##Color Theory

###Creative Bloq
[http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290](http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290)

- two primary color systems
    + additive
    + subtractive
- **Additive**
    + these are for colors emitting light (like a screen)
    + based on adding colors, usually RGB
    + white is the combination, black is the absence
- **Subtractive**
    + for colors reflecting lights (also known as reflective) and for print
    + based on cyan, magenta, yellow (and 'key' which is basically black)
    + combo is black, absence white

What makes a color different?
1. **hue** - refers to position on color wheel, base of color, expressed in degrees
2. **saturation** - how rich a color is, lowest being grayscale, expressed in percentage
3. **brightness** - brightness of color, expressed as percentage
4. **color gamut** - refers to the colors we can make from others (like rgb and reflective)

##Creative Bloq on choosing color themes
[http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/choose-colour-theme-712364](http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/choose-colour-theme-712364)

1. Psychology and Symbolism - think stoplights
2. Consider audience - red in west (passion) vs red in east (wealth)
3. Use your source assets - [kuler](http://color.adobe.com) is great for this
4. Limit your palette
5. use shades and tints - one base color and then extrapolate
6. Be bold
